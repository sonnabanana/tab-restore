Welcome to Tab Restore. With the help by `chrome.sessions` API released in Chrome 37, Tab Restore can restore the tabs you closed, not only reopen a page with the same URL, but also with the full navigation histories, and even the tabs you closed in the last time you using Chrome.

## Tips ##

1. When you just open Chrome, the tab restore lists may be empty. You need to press Ctrl+Shift+T to restore some closed sessions, and then the last time Chrome closed sessions will be activated. (For Windows users. Chrome for OS X seems OK)

2. You can use 1~9 hotkeys to quick open the most recent sessions. (*Currently not working*)
